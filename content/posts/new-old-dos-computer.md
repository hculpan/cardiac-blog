If you've read the original project proposal, you'll know that my final test for CARDIAC was to run it on a real DOS computer. Early on in the project, I had taken an older computer I had just lying around and installed MS-DOS 6.22. The computer is old from today's standpoint, being from 2006. But it's still a decade beyond DOS. So it isn't a "real" DOS computer. And I don't just mean because it's a 2.66 GHz CPU. I mean it's not a DOS computer at a hardware level. The video card didn't display VGA correctly, no ISA slots, no PS/2 (or even the older style keyboard) connectors, things like that. Still, it was better doing DOS development on it than on an emulator, and it felt closer to working on "real" hardware.

But this project has stoked my interest in DOS and gaming, so I started watching eBay for a suitable DOS computer, anything from a 486 to a Pentium. I had mentioned this in a prior blog post, but I also indicated that they were all more expensive than I was willing to pay, anywhere in the range of $300 to $500 with shipping.

But then I finally found one that was only $160, shipping included. It's an IBM 350, sn 6587. It was complete with everything except a hard drive, which was fine with me since I would just swap that out for a solid state storage solution, an SD card or SSD.

It came out in 1997, right at the end of the DOS era; the last standalone version, MS-DOS 6.22, having been released only 3 years earlier. When it was originally sold, this model came with Windows 95 by default. But I don't doubt that this computer and other comparable machines were used for DOS. It's definitely at the higher end of DOS machines for the day, but still this is a model that could have reasonably been used to run DOS and Windows 3.1. In other words, it's a "real" DOS machine, albeit, maybe a bit beefier than what most people ran DOS on.

The system came with a Pentium running at 166Mhz, 32 MB of RAM, and an onboard S3 video card that's not too shabby. There was also one PCI card in the system, a 3Com network card. It has a floppy drive and a CD-ROM, but as I mentioned earlier no hard drive. (The photo of the BIOS System Summary above was taken after I'd installed a 240 GB SSD; the BIOS could only see 8 GB of it though.) It has five ISA slots and 3 PCI slots, but the PCI shares space with 3 of the ISA slots, so you could only have a total of five cards in it. It also has two USB 1.1 ports. And, oddly, a built-in infrared sensor. As far as I can tell, nearly everything appears to be working, though I can't test the infrared, of course.

Aesthetically, I was very pleased with the computer. It's still a beige box so typical of the time, but it has a sliding panel on the front that hides the floppy and CD-ROM, and the overall styling is typical IBM industrial, which I like. It's not as pretty as most modern computers, to be sure, and a friend of mine I showed it to said it looked ugly. But to me it's the best-looking desktop of the DOS era that I've every worked on.

If you look at the picture above of the front of the computer, you can see there is a little bit of cosmetic damage. The front panel for the CD-ROM is missing, though the drive works just fine, and one of the fins on the sliding panel (check the photo below for how it looks with sliding panel closed) is also bent. The case also has some scuffs that aren't visible in the photos, but it's all relatively minor damage and to be expected of a computer this old.

I've made a few upgrades. I've replaced the physcial floppy with another Gotek floppy emulator. I talked about this device at some length in a prior blog, so I won't repeat myself here. But I continue to be impressed with how well it works. I also added a SoundBlaster 16 ISA card I purchased off eBay, and this works perfectly. And I put in a 240 GB SSD, though the BIOS sees it as only an 8 GB HD. It's actually a SATA drive, but I used an IDE-to-SATA adapter to make it work.

It was during the installation of the SSD that I ran into problems, and possibly found the first malfunctioning component in the computer. I couldn't get BIOS to see the hard drive at all, and in fact it would actually lock up the machine. When the BIOS saw that there was a change to the configuration because of the new drive, it would automatically take me into BIOS - and then lock up. And from time to time when I booted into DOS off the floppy, the keyboard would just not work. I banged my head against the wall for hours trying to figure this out, and then I just stumbled on the solution. I had plugged in a PS/2 mouse, but hadn't used it because I hadn't gotten to anything that used the mouse. When dealing with problems like this, one approach of course is just to remove everything you can, so at some point I finally just removed the mouse. I had no real expectation this would do anything, but as soon as I removed it all my problems went away. I have no idea whether it's the mouse itself or the PS/2 connector on the motherboard or whatever, as I had no other PS/2 mouse to test. But fortunately I did have a serial mouse (a very odd model, Q500, check out this video [Q500 digital mouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6lxwjX2Bk) for a very interesting analysis of the mouse), so I hooked that up and it worked just fine.

With the hard drive issue finally settled, I installed MS-DOS 6.22 and Windows 98 in a dual-boot setup, and both run quite well. I was using CD-ROM's to install/transfer some software (I have a USB DVD writer I can use on my other computers), but I've since gotten Windows 98 connected to my LAN, and I can use FTP to transfer stuff between my Mac and Windows 98. Additionally, I am using a virtual CD driver in Windows 98 that allows me to mount ISO images just as if they were physical CD's. And I created a 50 MB partition that can be seen by both my DOS and Windows 98 installations (they're in separate partitions), so I can use that to transfer stuff to DOS even though it's not on the network.

One other little detail I haven't mentioned: If you look at the above photo of the BIOS System Summary, you may notice that the monitor has an aspect ratio of 4:3 (standard) instead of 16:9 (widescreen). I had been running DOS on a widescreen monitor at first, but while text mode looked just fine, graphical applications looked more stretched out. I noticed the stretching effect with CARDIAC. It looked noticeably different on my earlier DOS computer that was hooked up to a widescreen monitor than it did when running under DosBox which resized it's window to the 4:3 aspect ratio that VGA was designed for.

All in all, I'm very pleased with this system, and with the cost. In total, counting the base unit and all the upgrades I did, I probably spent between $300 to $350. That's obviously more than I indicated above I wanted to spend, but most of these upgrades would have been done on any computer I bought, which is part of what I factored into my price threshold. So if I'd bought one of the other units I'd seen on eBay, I would have still bought the Gotek floppy emulator, an SSD drive, and the standard aspect ratio monitor. So when you consider the total cost, I think I saved around $150 compared to the other units I was seeing on eBay.

For this project, this will be my primary development machine, though I'll still have to do my performance testing on DosBox since I'm targeting hardware much lower than a Pentium.
